            <h2 class="mt4">THE STUDIO</h2>
            <p>A group of weird people making weird games. That's basically it.</p>
            <p>What? You want to know more? Huh.</p>
            <p>WELL! We make whatever we want to make. As long as it barely looks like a game. Or something like that. We make games because we can. The goal is to create cool things that cool people find cool. That's the spirit. We experiment a lot with unique concepts and weird ideas. We want to make games that no one else made before.</p>
            <p>We do not stick to any particular genre. We like to try new things and keep things fresh. However if we see that something works and we have <i>fun</i> making it... We might make more of it!</p>
            <h3 class="mt4">ONE LAST THING</h3>
            <p>We are making games for the creative process. Making money isn't our goal, as we're all doing this in our free time, beside our main jobs.</p>
            <p>Teagher Studio is an assocation that seek to create cool artistic pieces and educate people about the process of making games.</p>
            <p class="mb4">We are all based in Normandy, France. You can find us in various events here and there showing our work to people.</p>
